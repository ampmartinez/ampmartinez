## Hi there 👋,


### Cytometry In R

- Location: San Diego, California, USA

- My Favorite Fluorophore/Metal-Isotope: Spark NIR 685 (?)

- Previous Coding Experience: A little bit of R for bulk transcriptomics.

- What I Hope to Get From This Course: A way of analysing A LOT of flow cytometry files without FlowJo crashing due to the files' size.
